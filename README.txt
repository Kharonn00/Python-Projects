Here is an example of how you could write a log-in button in Python using the tkinter library, 
which is a built-in library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python.

____________

This code will create a GUI with a label and an entry widget for the username, 
and a label and an entry widget for the password. It will also create a button labeled "Log In". 
When the button is clicked, the on_login_button_clicked function will be called, 
which gets the username and password from the entry widgets and performs the login process.
